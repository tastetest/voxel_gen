-- TODO --
-- figure out how to do complexplanet.rs in the noisers/examples/ folder --
1. Create noise generation for voxels
2. destructible environments

# some stuff that I added:
1. 2d noise generation, It generates within a file, with certain specifications i give it, using noise-rs


-- i added in some pseudo code for now. But i'm going to work on some chunk generation tomorrow to get a feel for how i want to write it out.
